## ~Usage~

<!-- This part's clumsy-->

crisp download [application name]&emsp;&emsp; download an application <br/>
crisp search [application name]&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; search for an application in the app-list <br/>
crisp list&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; list all the applications in the app-list    

<!--Note: Make sure to append '-32bit' after every application name, without spaces, if you want to install the 32bit version of the program, if any.
      However, for programs that only support 64bit version, this cannot be done, but for those who only support 32bit, no need of adding the tag.-->
